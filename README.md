# Airtable Timeline

## WHAT I LIKED ABOUT MY IMPLEMENTATION

- I could define components that is very maintainable.
- I've used **TailwindCSS** to make styling easier.

## WHAT I WOULD CHANGE IF I WERE TO DO IT AGAIN

- I'd invest time fixing the **lanes** position.
- I'd add **year** selection.
- I'd implement an **alt text** to display trucated names.
- I'd add **eslint** to improve **code quality**.
- I'd also implement a **Drag&Drop** feature to update start and end dates.

## HOW I MADE DESIGN DECISIONS

- I investigated some timelines images searching on internet.
- I decided a **simple design** to understand clearly.

## HOW I WOULD TEST THIS APPLICATION

- **Unit tests** should be implemented for each component.
- I'd implement **integration tests** with the provided data **timelineItems.js**.
